Hi, My name is Cheng Zheng.


**I am gonna force myself (2017-July to 2018-July) Come up with idea, validate & build  & launch**


## Every 2 month
the reason for that is because 1 month is too short for me to actually done something.  

<br/>
<br/>


I am super inspire by the Nomad List ["I'm Launching 12 Startups in 12 Months"](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/)

also the [Indie Hacker Interview](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses)


<br/>
<br/>

I am not just recently "discover" them, I watch these for quite some time now.  


 Paul Graham, YC(blog), Sam Altman, Courtland Allen, Instapaintng, people's post in IH forum. Product Hunt, Slack: startupstudygroup, Sideproject, zero2growth.
 bunch of YC video on Youtube, <<Start Small Stay Small>>, Hacker News(Ask HN/Show HN)


<br/>
<br/>


I am 22, Web developer with 2 years experience, (first year PHP, second year Ruby on Rails, and I am gonna continue use RoR)


weak on Front-End (only know jQuery)(Working on it, Ember.js + React.js)

**I really like the idea of make a product people like, and people pay for the product. and I can make living on that.**


I have done onsite job, remote job, now I want more freedom.
