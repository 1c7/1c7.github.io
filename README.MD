Github Pages + Jekyll + Custom domain  

`master` branch is for Github Pages  
`code` branch is Jekyll

### Jekyll 101 
after you finish bloging, you want generate static website  
call ```jekyll build```  
that would generate a new folder call `_site`,  
the `_site` is your static website, done. awesome.  

if you need deploy it to Github Pages  
what you need to do is copy&paste what's inside `_site` folder  
put into Github master branch, that's how github pages work  
and then git push, see magic happen
